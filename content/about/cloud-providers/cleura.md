# Cleura

An OpenStack account is needed to run SAAP on [Cleura](https://cleura.com/).

Cleura offers [compliant cloud](https://cleura.com/services/compliant-cloud/), [public cloud](https://cleura.com/services/public-cloud/), and [private cloud](https://cleura.com/services/private-cloud/), and SAAP can run on all of them.

The minimum quotas needed to be able to deploy SAAP in your account is listed on [Sizing of SAAP](../../for-administrators/plan-your-environment/sizing.md).

Cleura is headquartered in Sweden.

If you are an existing Cleura customer, talk to your Cleura representative to setup SAAP in your account.

If you would like to become a Cleura customer, sign up for one of their clouds and talk to Cleura to get SAAP.
