# Account Management

## Billing

SAAP requires a minimum base cluster purchase with minimum technical requirements specified in [Sizing](../../for-administrators/plan-your-environment/sizing.md).

Customers can either use their existing cloud infrastructure account to deploy SAAP, or use one of Stakater's partners to create infrastructure. The customer always pays Stakater for the SAAP subscription and pays the cloud provider for the cloud costs. It is the customer's responsibility to pre-purchase or provide compute instances to ensure lower cloud infrastructure costs.

Billing for SAAP is on a monthly basis, or yearly basis with discounts.

## Cloud Providers

SAAP is available as a managed platform on the cloud providers listed on the [cloud providers overview](../cloud-providers/overview.md).
