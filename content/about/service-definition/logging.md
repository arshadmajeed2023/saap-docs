# Logging

SAAP provides an optional integrated log forwarding to log store.

## Cluster audit logging

Cluster audit logs are available through log store, if the integration is enabled. If the integration is not enabled, you can request the audit logs by opening a support case.

## Application logging

Application logs sent to STDOUT are collected by log collector and forwarded to log store through the cluster logging stack, if it is installed.

## Data retention

By default only 7 days data is kept; and if you want to store for long term then open a support case.
