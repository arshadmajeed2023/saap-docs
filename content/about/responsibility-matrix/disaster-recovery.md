# Disaster Recovery

Stakater is responsible for the recovery of Red Hat OpenShift in case of disaster. You are responsible for the recovery of the workloads that run the cluster and your applications data. If you integrate with other cloud services such as file, block, object, cloud database, logging, or audit event services, consult those services' disaster recovery information.
