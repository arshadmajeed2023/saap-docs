# Overview

The first thing that you will need to do for your Tekton pipeline to work is to create a Repository CR. The Repository CR tells pipeline-as-code controller that events from a specific repository need to be handled. It also provides a way for pipeline as code controller to authenticate with the GitHub repository through a personal access token.

We will add the Repository CR in three steps.

* First, we will generate a personal access token on GitHub.
* Second, we will create an External Secret and add the token to Vault.
* Last, we will create a repository CR and reference the secret in it.
