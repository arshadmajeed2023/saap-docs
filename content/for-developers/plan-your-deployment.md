# Plan your Deployment

In this section, we are going to briefly discuss considerations for migrating your application workloads to `Stakater App Agility Platform (SAAP)`.

## Application

You need to gather knowledge about the application. Following questions can be considered for evaluating your application requirements:

- Do you need to run your application as container?
- Is it stateless or stateful?
- What components make up the application being migrated? Is it a single service or a collection of services that work together?
- What users need to access this service ?
- Is your application containerized ?
- What configurations are required by the application ?
- What files and directories are used by the application ?
- What are the CPU/Memory requirements ?
