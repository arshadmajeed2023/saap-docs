# Overview

Multi Tenant Operator (MTO) provides easy-to-manage multi-tenancy. It provides wrappers around OpenShift resources to provide a higher level of abstraction to users. With MTO, admins can configure Network and Security Policies, Resource Quotas, Limit Ranges, RBAC for every tenant, which are automatically inherited by all the namespaces and users in the tenant. Depending on the user's role, they are free to operate within their tenants in complete autonomy.
